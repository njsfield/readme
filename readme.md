## Investigate EventEmitters and the event module (Tom & Steve)

- What are event emitters and event listeners?
- What's the observer pattern aka the publish/ subscribe pattern?

## Investigate Streams and the stream module (Nick & Shireen)

- What are streams?
- What types of streams are there?

These concepts can get quite abstract. What are some common examples of EventEmitters and Streams in node we're likely to come across as a group?
Can you think of any small program ideas or code samples you can use to demonstrate and talk through these concepts with the group?
